# Fares and shortest route Calculator

## Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm

For finding the shorthest path between **A** and **B** I used Dijkstra's algorithm. 
For my challenge, any airport is a **node**, any flight is an **edge**, flight's distances are **weight**. The network is a directed graph.

## Running

>Open the Project folder using Visual Studio Code / Node.js

>Open terminal and type "npm install" in order to install all the dependencies

and

>"npm start" in order to launch the web page in your default browser

I've run the web page with chrome and firefox and worked as I expected with both of them
